Encryption, Decryption
==============
Objective: Scramble and unscramble a string given a key.
Scored: Correctness and Difficulty to Crack

Encryption:  
  Example Input: "hello there how are you", "key"  
  Example Ouput: "asdfas;kjvncx,msac'[k a"
  
Decryption:  
  Example Input: "asdfas;kjvncx,msac'[k a", "key"  
  Example Ouput: "hello there how are you"
  
The algorithm should not need a key of the same length as the message. One time pads are not useful.
